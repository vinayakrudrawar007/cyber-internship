Cyber Internship Project Repository 🚀🔐
Welcome to my Cyber Internship project portfolio! This repository features four practical cybersecurity tools I developed during my internship to strengthen real-world security skills.

What’s Inside? 🎯
1. 🔍 File Integrity Checker
A simple yet essential tool that uses SHA-256 hashing to create a baseline snapshot of files and regularly compares them to detect any unauthorized changes or tampering. This ensures data integrity and helps in early threat detection.

2. 🌐 Web Vulnerability Scanner
A basic scanner designed for authorized web applications to identify common vulnerabilities like misconfigurations or exposed endpoints. Perfect for learning how web security assessments are conducted responsibly.

3. 🛠️ Penetration Testing Toolkit
Comprises a port scanner to discover open network ports and services, plus an offline password checker that validates password strength using wordlists. This toolkit supports practicing penetration testing techniques on local environments.

4. 🔒 AES-GCM Encryption Tool
A secure file encryptor and decryptor built with AES-GCM (Advanced Encryption Standard - Galois/Counter Mode) providing confidentiality and data integrity. Ideal for protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access.

Why This Matters 💡
Demonstrates hands-on experience building security tools from scratch

Applies essential cybersecurity concepts like hashing, encryption, and vulnerability scanning

Prepares for real-world challenges in ethical hacking and data protection

Showcases strong programming and problem-solving skills in Python

A valuable portfolio addition for cybersecurity internship and job opportunities
